Added a new diagnostics module `thomson` containing a function
`spectral_density` that calculates Thomson scattering spectra for
Maxwellian plasmas in both the collective and non-collective regimes. As
a followup to PR #835, set the minimal required Numpy version to 1.18.1 to
finally fix unit dropping bugs.
